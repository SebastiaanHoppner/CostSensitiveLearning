# CostSensitiveLearning
Instance-dependent cost-sensitive learning using lasso-regularized logistic regression and gradient boosted decision trees. These methods introduce instance-dependent costs into a lasso-regularized logistic regression and a gradient tree boosting algorithm (i.e. xgboost) by changing the objective function of the respective model to one that is cost-sensitive.
